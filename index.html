        <h2>About Me</h2>
     <p>Hi, I am Nompumelelo Mthembu. I am an electrician by profession and a software engineering enthusiast eager to transition into the tech world. My passion for technology drives me to learn coding, software development, and automation. I am sharpening my skills in HTML, CSS and Python. I am currently building my skills in JavaScript, Java, PHP and C++, e.t.c working on small projects to gain hands-on experience. My background in electrical systems gives me a unique perspective on integrating hardware and software. I am fascinated by IoT, embedded systems, and smart automation. I enjoy solving problems and continuously improving my technical knowledge. Though I have no formal experience in software engineering yet, I am dedicated to learning, building, and growing in the field. I actively work on personal projects and online courses to sharpen my skills. My goal is to combine my electrical expertise with software development to create innovative solutions. I am excited about the journey ahead and open to opportunities to learn and collaborate.</p>
